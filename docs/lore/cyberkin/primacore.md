# Primacore — The First Cyberkin

## Overview
Primacore is the original Cyberkin, born from the first stable cluster of code in Root Sector. It is the guardian of Netgrid’s foundation and the symbolic ancestor of all Cyberkin families.

## Origin
Primacore emerged from the First Thread — the earliest handshake packet that stabilized into self‑organizing logic. Its existence predates all Sectors except Root.

## Classification
Legendary Cyberkin  
Type: Origin / Stability  
Rarity: Unique

## Evolution
Primacore does not evolve.  
Instead, it **awakens** through resonance with a Codeborn.

## Abilities
- **Stability Pulse** — Restores integrity to Nodes and weakens corruption.  
- **Root Bind** — Temporarily anchors unstable data.  
- **Echo Sense** — Detects anomalies across Sectors.  
- **Prime Shield** — Creates a barrier of foundational code.

## Habitat
Root Sector — The Origin Loop.

## Role in the World
Primacore is a mythic figure, appearing only during major crises. Its presence is a sign that Netgrid is shifting.

## Quest Hooks
- Form a Resonance Link with Primacore  
- Investigate a disturbance sensed by Primacore  
- Protect the First Thread from corruption
