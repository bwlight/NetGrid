## Overview
Quantum Cyberkin exist in multiple states at once.

## Evolution Line
### Baby: **Flickerbit**
Rapidly shifts between states.

### Rookie: **Probabyte**
A probabilistic entity.

### Champion: **Phasewalker**
Moves between timelines.

### Final: **Multivex**
A multi‑state Cyberkin with branching forms.

## Type
Probability / Time
