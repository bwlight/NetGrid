# Fractal Family — The Recursive Cyberkin

## Overview
Fractal Cyberkin are complex, geometric beings formed from recursive algorithms.

## Evolution Line
### Baby: **Pixlet**
A tiny repeating pattern.

### Rookie: **Fractlet**
Begins forming recursive loops.

### Champion: **Spiralith**
A swirling geometric construct.

### Final: **Infinitrix**
A massive, self‑generating fractal entity.

## Type
Logic / Pattern

## Abilities
- Recursive Strike  
- Pattern Lock  
- Infinite Loop  

## Habitat
Fractal Sector — Pattern Vault.

## Evolution Requirements
- Solve recursive puzzles  
- Maintain high logic stat  
- Exposure to fractal Nodes  

## Role in Netgrid
They stabilize complex structures and decode anomalies.

## Quest Hooks
- Solve a recursive anomaly  
- Help a Fractlet complete its pattern  
- Investigate an Infinitrix generating unstable loops
