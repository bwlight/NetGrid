# Quantum Sector

## Overview
A region where data exists in multiple states simultaneously.

## Origin
Formed from probabilistic algorithms and quantum‑inspired code.

## Function
Handles prediction models, branching paths, and multi‑state data.

## Atmosphere
Unstable, shimmering, paradoxical. Reality feels uncertain.

## Hazards
- Data superposition collapse
- Probability spikes
- Quantum drift

## Gate Node
`quantum-gate`

## Stream Node
`quantum-stream`

## Neighbor Sectors
- Fractal (counter‑clockwise)
- Neon (clockwise)

## Cyberkin Affinity
Probability‑based, multi‑form, or time‑skipping Cyberkin.

## Notable Locations
- The Probability Well
- The Schrodinger Node
- The Branching Nexus

## Quest Hooks
- Resolve a collapsing probability field
- Track a Cyberkin shifting between states
- Explore a branching timeline anomaly
