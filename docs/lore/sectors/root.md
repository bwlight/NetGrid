# Root Sector

## Overview
The northern hub of Netgrid and the oldest stable region in existence. All data threads ultimately trace their lineage back to Root.

## Origin
Root formed from the earliest handshake packets exchanged between primitive networks. It is the “seed” from which Netgrid grew.

## Function
Acts as the central routing heart of the system, managing foundational data and long‑distance transfers.

## Atmosphere
Calm, structured, ancient. Codeborn describe it as a cathedral of logic.

## Hazards
- Echo storms (repeating packets)
- Memory residue
- Low‑level corruption pockets

## Gate Node
`root-gate`

## Stream Node
`root-stream`

## Neighbor Sectors
- Pulse (clockwise)
- Horizon (counter‑clockwise)

## Cyberkin Affinity
Primacore and other First‑Generation Cyberkin.

## Notable Locations
- The First Thread
- The Archive Pillar
- The Origin Loop

## Quest Hooks
- Investigate a repeating echo storm
- Recover corrupted packets from the Origin Loop
- Guide a newborn Cyberkin through stabilization
