# Pulse Sector

## Overview
A vibrant region of rhythmic energy and constant data flow.

## Origin
Formed from the heartbeat‑like bursts of early network traffic.

## Function
Handles high‑frequency data, live signals, and rapid updates.

## Atmosphere
Bright, neon, energetic. Everything pulses with motion.

## Hazards
- Overload surges
- Signal distortion
- Rapid‑shift currents

## Gate Node
`pulse-gate`

## Stream Node
`pulse-stream`

## Neighbor Sectors
- Root (counter‑clockwise)
- Echo (clockwise)

## Cyberkin Affinity
Speed‑based and signal‑aligned Cyberkin.

## Notable Locations
- The Resonance Corridor
- The Neon Pulseway
- The Signal Forge

## Quest Hooks
- Stabilize a runaway data surge
- Track a lost Cyberkin caught in a pulse loop
- Decode a corrupted rhythm pattern
