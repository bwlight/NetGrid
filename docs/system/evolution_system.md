# 🧬 Netgrid Evolution System — Master Blueprint
Evolution in Netgrid is driven by four pillars:

1. Stats (growth, training, species bias)

2. Care (bond, discipline, mistakes, mood)

3. Corruption (instability, environment, neglect)

4. Conditions (time, weight, sector, personality, party synergy)

This gives you a system that feels:
- Digimon‑inspired
- Tamagotchi‑reactive
- RPG‑meaningful
- Netgrid‑unique

Let’s break it down.

## 1. Evolution Stages
Every Cyberkin follows the same structural path:
###     Baby → Rookie → Champion → Final
But each family has:
- multiple Champion branches
- multiple Final branches
- at least one Corrupt branch

This gives you:
- Good → Good
- Good → Neutral
- Neutral → Good
- Neutral → Corrupt
- Corrupt → Corrupt
- Corrupt → Redemption (rare)

## 2. Evolution Score (Core Formula)
This is the central calculation that determines which evolution paths are eligible.

    EvolutionScore = (Stats) + (Bond × 2) + (Discipline) − (Corruption × 1.5) + (TrainingPoints)

Where:
- Stats = sum of ATK + DATK + DEF + DDEF + SPD
- Bond = emotional connection
- Discipline = obedience/stability
- Corruption = instability
- TrainingPoints = effort invested

This score is compared to each evolution’s required range.

## 3. Evolution Requirements (Per Branch)
Each evolution form has a requirement profile:

### Good Evolution
- EvolutionScore: High
- Bond: > 60
- Discipline: > 50
- Corruption: < 20
- Care Mistakes: < 3

### Neutral Evolution
- EvolutionScore: Mid
- Bond: 30–60
- Discipline: 30–50
- Corruption: 20–60
- Care Mistakes: 0–5

### Corrupt Evolution
- EvolutionScore: Low
- Bond: < 30
- Discipline: < 30
- Corruption: > 60
- Care Mistakes: > 5

### Special Evolutions
These are optional but fun:
- Weight‑based
- Time‑based (night/day)
- Sector‑based (evolving in a specific GPS biome)
- Personality‑based
- Party‑synergy‑based

## 4. Evolution Timing
Evolution checks happen when:

### Baby → Rookie
- After a fixed time
- No branching
- Care mistakes influence Rookie stats

### Rookie → Champion
Triggered by:
- Level threshold
- EvolutionScore check
- Care stats
- Corruption state

### Champion → Final
Triggered by:
- Level threshold
- EvolutionScore check
- Care stats
- Corruption state
- Special conditions (optional)

## 5. Corruption Evolution Logic
Corruption is a parallel evolution path, not a punishment — it’s a theme.

### Corrupt Evolution Trigger
A Corrupt evolution becomes eligible when:
        Corruption > 60
AND
        EvolutionScore < CorruptThreshold

CorruptThreshold is usually 100.

### Corruption Overrides
If Corruption > 90:
- Corrupt evolution becomes forced
- Unless a Redemption condition is met

### Redemption Evolution
Rare, special evolution triggered when:
- Corruption > 60
- Bond > 80
- Discipline > 70
- Mood > 70

This gives you emotional storytelling.

## 6. Evolution Priority System
If multiple evolutions are eligible, the system chooses based on:
- Corruption priority
- Special evolution conditions
- Highest matching EvolutionScore range
- Personality modifiers
- Random variance (5–10%)

This keeps evolution:
- Predictable
- But not robotic

## 7. Evolution Preview System (Optional UI Feature)
Before evolving, the player can see:
- Eligible forms
- Requirements met/not met
- “Likely evolution”
- “Risk of corruption”

This helps players understand the system without needing a wiki.
