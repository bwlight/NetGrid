# 🕳️ Void Family — Bestiary Entry
Sector: Void
Type: Null / Purge
File: void.json
The Void Family embodies deletion, entropy, and nullification.
These Cyberkin purge corrupted data, collapse unstable structures, and erase harmful processes from the Netgrid.
Their evolution reflects increasing mastery over void‑logic, anti‑data fields, and entropy manipulation.

Void Cyberkin are feared and respected — they are not inherently malicious, but their presence signals that something nearby is unstable, corrupted, or nearing collapse.

## 🧬 Evolution Line
Baby — Nullbit
A tiny, flickering construct that absorbs small fragments of stray data.
Nullbit is quiet and harmless, but its presence slightly reduces ambient energy.

Stats:

HP: 15

Attack: 8

Defense: 10

Speed: 9

Intelligence: 12

Stability: 14

Rookie — Hollowbyte
Nullbit evolves into Hollowbyte when its internal void‑core stabilizes.
Hollowbyte can generate small null fields that erase minor data fragments or weaken corrupted processes.

Stats:

HP: 30

Attack: 18

Defense: 22

Speed: 18

Intelligence: 24

Stability: 28

Champion — Deletor
A powerful void construct capable of purging corrupted Nodes.
Deletor emits controlled deletion waves that strip away unstable or harmful data.

Stats:

HP: 55

Attack: 34

Defense: 40

Speed: 32

Intelligence: 42

Stability: 50

Final — Voidreaver
The pinnacle of Void evolution.
Voidreaver is a devastating purifier capable of collapsing entire corrupted regions, erasing anomalies, and stabilizing Sectors through controlled entropy.

Stats:

HP: 100

Attack: 60

Defense: 70

Speed: 50

Intelligence: 70

Stability: 90

## 🔧 Abilities
Null Pulse — Releases a wave that erases minor data and weakens corrupted foes.

Entropy Field — Creates a zone that destabilizes enemy abilities and reduces their effectiveness.

Data Purge — A powerful deletion strike that removes harmful effects and damages corrupted entities.

## 🏛️ Habitat
Void Sector — Null Expanse  
A silent, dim region of collapsing structures, drifting fragments, and anti‑data currents.

## 🔼 Evolution Requirements
Exposure to corrupted or unstable Nodes

High stability or intelligence

Completion of a purge‑based trial

## 📜 Quest Hooks
Assist a Nullbit absorbing dangerous stray data

Help a Hollowbyte contain a spreading corruption leak

Investigate a Voidreaver purging an entire region to prevent collapse

## 🧠 Behavior & Lore
Void Cyberkin are calm, focused, and emotionless.
They act with precision, removing only what must be removed to preserve the Netgrid.
Their presence is often a warning — something nearby is unstable, corrupted, or on the verge of collapse.
