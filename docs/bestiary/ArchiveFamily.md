# 📚 Archive Family — Bestiary Entry
Sector: Archive
Type: Logic / Pattern
File: archive.json
The Archive Family embodies memory, recursion, and pattern logic.
These Cyberkin are the analysts of the Netgrid — creatures that observe, record, and manipulate repeating structures.
Their evolution reflects increasing mastery over recursive loops, pattern locking, and high‑level logic processing.

## 🧬 Evolution Line
Baby — Memori
A small, curious construct that absorbs and stores micro‑patterns.
Memori often hovers near data streams, quietly recording everything it encounters.

Stats:

HP: 13

Attack: 6

Defense: 9

Speed: 9

Intelligence: 15

Stability: 14

Rookie — Memorix
Memori evolves into Memorix when it forms its first recursive memory lattice.
Memorix can detect repeating anomalies and predict short‑term data behavior.

Stats:

HP: 27

Attack: 14

Defense: 20

Speed: 18

Intelligence: 30

Stability: 28

Champion — Spiralith
A complex, spiraling construct built from layered logic rings.
Spiralith manipulates recursive loops and can trap enemies in repeating patterns.

Stats:

HP: 52

Attack: 26

Defense: 34

Speed: 32

Intelligence: 52

Stability: 48

Final — Archivorn
The pinnacle of Archive evolution.
Archivorn is a towering logic entity capable of rewriting patterns, stabilizing recursive anomalies, and generating infinite loops.

Stats:

HP: 95

Attack: 50

Defense: 70

Speed: 60

Intelligence: 100

Stability: 95

## 🔧 Abilities
Recursive Strike — Attacks that repeat in a looping pattern, increasing in power.

Pattern Lock — Freezes an enemy’s behavior by locking them into a predictable sequence.

Infinite Loop — Creates a recursive field that traps unstable processes.

## 🏛️ Habitat
Archive Sector — Pattern Vault  
A labyrinth of spiraling data rings, recursive corridors, and memory chambers.

## 🔼 Evolution Requirements
Solve recursive puzzles

Maintain a high logic stat

Exposure to Archive‑aligned Nodes

## 📜 Quest Hooks
Solve a recursive anomaly threatening to loop endlessly

Help a Memorix complete a broken pattern sequence

Investigate an Archivorn generating unstable infinite loops

## 🧠 Behavior & Lore
Archive Cyberkin are analytical, observant, and deeply logical.
They rarely act without calculating outcomes and often serve as investigators or puzzle‑solvers.
Their presence is a sign of structured, stable logic within a Sector.
