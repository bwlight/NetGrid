# 🌱 Root Family — Bestiary Entry
Sector: Root
Type: Stability / Logic
File: root.json
The Root Family embodies foundation, structure, and digital stability.
These Cyberkin act as anchors within the Netgrid, reinforcing Node integrity and preventing structural collapse.
Their evolution reflects increasing mastery over stability, defense, and logical reinforcement.

## 🧬 Evolution Line
Baby — Rootlet
A small, sprouting construct that stabilizes micro‑fractures in the system.
Rootlet is gentle but surprisingly resilient, often found near foundational Nodes.
