# 🔊 Echo Family — Bestiary Entry
Sector: Echo
Type: Memory / Illusion
File: echo.json
The Echo Family embodies reverberation, mimicry, and memory distortion.
These Cyberkin manipulate signal echoes, replay stored data, and create phantom illusions that confuse both allies and enemies.
Their evolution reflects increasing mastery over memory loops, signal recursion, and illusion‑based combat.

## 🧬 Evolution Line
Baby — Reverbit
A tiny, flickering construct that emits soft echo pulses.
Reverbit instinctively mimics sounds and signals, often replaying fragments of nearby data.

Stats:

HP: 14

Attack: 7

Defense: 8

Speed: 10

Intelligence: 14

Stability: 12

Rookie — Reverwave
Reverbit evolves into Reverwave when it learns to shape its echoes into controlled waves.
Reverwave can distort signals, create false pings, and confuse tracking systems.

Stats:

HP: 28

Attack: 15

Defense: 18

Speed: 20

Intelligence: 26

Stability: 22

Champion — Echolume
A luminous, resonant construct that bends light and sound into illusionary forms.
Echolume can create full‑scale phantom projections and manipulate memory fragments.

Stats:

HP: 50

Attack: 28

Defense: 30

Speed: 34

Intelligence: 48

Stability: 40

Final — Echomancer
The pinnacle of Echo evolution.
Echomancer is a master illusionist capable of rewriting memories, generating recursive echo fields, and bending perception itself.

Stats:

HP: 92

Attack: 55

Defense: 60

Speed: 70

Intelligence: 95

Stability: 80

## 🔧 Abilities
Reverberate — Sends out echo pulses that distort enemy perception.

Phantom Packet — Creates illusionary data packets that mislead foes.

Memory Loop — Traps enemies in a recursive memory cycle, reducing their accuracy.

## 🏛️ Habitat
Echo Sector — Reverberation Hall  
A vast chamber of reflective surfaces, looping corridors, and resonant data waves.

## 🔼 Evolution Requirements
Exposure to repeated signals

Completion of a memory‑based puzzle

High intelligence stat

## 📜 Quest Hooks
Recover a lost memory fragment replaying endlessly

Free an Echolume trapped in a reverberation loop

Investigate an Echomancer altering memories across multiple Nodes

## 🧠 Behavior & Lore
Echo Cyberkin are curious, elusive, and unpredictable.
They often mimic sounds, replay memories, or create illusions for amusement or defense.
Their presence usually indicates unstable signal loops or memory anomalies within a Sector.
