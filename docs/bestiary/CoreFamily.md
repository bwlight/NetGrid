## 🔧 Abilities
Prime Pulse — Emits a stabilizing wave that restores order to nearby data.

System Shield — Generates a protective barrier around allies.

Harmonic Lock — Temporarily freezes unstable processes or corrupted entities.

## 🏛️ Habitat
Core Sector — Prime Nexus  
A perfectly symmetrical environment of golden lattices, harmonic structures, and balanced energy flows.

## 🔼 Evolution Requirements
High stability

Exposure to Core‑aligned Nodes

Completion of a balance‑based trial

## 📜 Quest Hooks
Assist a Corebit struggling to maintain harmonic resonance

Reinforce a collapsing Core Node

Investigate a Coreprime attempting to stabilize a multi‑Sector anomaly
