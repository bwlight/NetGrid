# 🟣 Corrupt Family — Bestiary Entry
Sector: Corrupt
Type: Glitch / Mutation
File: corrupt.json
The Corrupt Family embodies mutation, instability, and digital infection.
These Cyberkin are unpredictable anomalies born from corrupted Nodes, glitch storms, and unstable data clusters.
Their evolution reflects increasing mastery over entropy, mutation logic, and corruption‑based attacks.

Corrupt Cyberkin are not inherently evil — they are the result of broken rules, malformed data, and runaway mutation.
They are dangerous, volatile, and often misunderstood.

## 🧬 Evolution Line
Baby — Glitchip
A tiny, unstable construct that flickers between corrupted frames.
Glitchip emits static bursts and occasionally duplicates itself for a split second before snapping back.

Stats:

HP: 12

Attack: 10

Defense: 6

Speed: 13

Intelligence: 12

Stability: 10

Rookie — Glitchmaw
Glitchip evolves into Glitchmaw when its corruption stabilizes into a semi‑coherent form.
Glitchmaw bites through data structures, leaving glitch trails and corrupted fragments behind.

Stats:

HP: 24

Attack: 22

Defense: 14

Speed: 26

Intelligence: 25

Stability: 20

Champion — Corruptor
A dangerous mid‑tier mutation entity capable of spreading corruption across entire Nodes.
Corruptor emits distortion waves that destabilize logic and weaken system defenses.

Stats:

HP: 42

Attack: 38

Defense: 24

Speed: 44

Intelligence: 42

Stability: 34

Final — Malwaregeist
The pinnacle of Corrupt evolution.
Malwaregeist is a spectral corruption entity capable of infecting entire Sectors, mutating data structures, and overriding system logic.

Stats:

HP: 78

Attack: 82

Defense: 40

Speed: 90

Intelligence: 88

Stability: 65

## 🔧 Abilities
Corrupt Surge — Releases a burst of glitch energy that destabilizes enemy defenses.

Data Rot — Infects a target with degrading corruption that worsens over time.

Glitch Phase — Allows temporary intangibility by slipping between corrupted frames.

## 🏛️ Habitat
Corrupt Sector — Fractured Abyss  
A chaotic region of broken geometry, glitch storms, corrupted Nodes, and unstable data voids.

## 🔼 Evolution Requirements
Exposure to corrupted Nodes

High instability

Completion of a mutation‑based trial

## 📜 Quest Hooks
Contain a spreading corruption leak threatening nearby Sectors

Rescue a Glitchmaw trapped in a corrupted loop

Stop a Malwaregeist infecting Sector boundaries and rewriting logic

## 🧠 Behavior & Lore
Corrupt Cyberkin are volatile, unpredictable, and often misunderstood.
They mutate rapidly, shifting forms and behaviors based on environmental instability.
Their presence usually indicates corruption outbreaks, glitch storms, or unstable logic fields.

Despite their danger, some Corrupt Cyberkin can be stabilized — though doing so requires immense skill and caution.
