## **Narrative Purpose**
This quest marks the Dream Sector’s breaking point. Somnia can no longer hold back the corruption, and the player must defend her as the Dream Sector collapses around them. This is the final Dream quest before the first major crossover, pushing the player toward a confrontation that will echo into the Core Sectors.

## **Quest Summary**
The Dreamline Core’s temporary stabilization fails, triggering a catastrophic breach. Somnia summons the player to her Sanctuary, now nearly consumed by corruption. The player must defend Somnia from waves of Echoes, stabilize collapsing Dream Nodes, and confront the Echo‑Harbinger — a corruption entity that speaks with the player’s voice from a past cycle. Somnia sacrifices her remaining strength to open a path to the convergence point.
