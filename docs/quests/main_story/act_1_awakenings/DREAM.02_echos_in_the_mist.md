## **Quest Title**
Echoes in the Mist

## **Quest Code**
DREAM.02

## **Sector**
Dream Sector — Mistway Corridor

## **Quest Type**
Main Story

## **Narrative Purpose**
This quest deepens the player’s connection to the Dream Sector and reveals that the corruption is not just a glitch — it has memory, intention, and patterns. The player learns how Corruption Echoes behave, why they appear in dreams first, and how resonance can be used to track or repel them. This quest transitions the tone from “tutorial” to “mystery.”

## **Quest Summary**
After stabilizing in the Dream Sector, the player follows Somnia’s guidance into the Mistway Corridor, a fog‑shrouded path where memories and corruption overlap. Strange Echoes flicker in and out of existence, mimicking past Codeborn voices. The player must navigate the corridor, protect their Cyberkin from emotional overload, and confront a stronger Echo that tries to latch onto their resonance. Completing the quest unlocks the Dream Sector’s first stable travel node and reveals a fragment of a past Codeborn’s final moments.

## **Objectives**
- Speak with Somnia at the Dream Sector’s edge
- Enter the Mistway Corridor
- Follow the resonance pulses
- Investigate the first Echo distortion
- Protect your Cyberkin from emotional overload
- Defeat the Mimic Echo
- Stabilize the Mistway Node

## **Sector State**
The Mistway Corridor is unstable and fog‑heavy.
Echoes drift through the mist like half‑formed memories.
The environment reacts to the player’s emotional state — fear thickens the fog, confidence thins it.
Corruption pulses distort the path, creating looping routes and false trails.

## **Key Characters**
- **Guardian:** Somnia
- **Allies:** Your starter Cyberkin
- **Enemies:** Mimic Echo (a corruption entity that imitates voices and shapes)

## **Cyberkin Emotional Beat**
Your Cyberkin becomes overwhelmed by the Echo’s emotional residue.
It experiences fear, confusion, and flashes of memories that aren’t its own.
When the Mimic Echo tries to copy the Cyberkin’s form, your partner panics — and you must calm it through resonance.
This moment strengthens your bond and unlocks a new emotional synergy.

## **Gameplay Mechanics Introduced or Highlighted**
- Emotional resonance (calming or empowering your Cyberkin)
- Mist navigation (following resonance pulses to avoid loops)
- Echo mimicry behavior
- First “emotion‑based” battle mechanic
- Node stabilization

## **Major Story Revelations**
- Echoes are not random — they are fragments of past Codeborn cycles.
- The corruption is learning from previous failures.
- The Mistway Corridor is a boundary between memory and reality.
- Your resonance signature is unique — the corruption reacts differently to you.

## **Memory / Lore Fragment Awarded**
- **Fragment Name:** The Last Walk
- **Fragment Meaning:** A blurred memory of a previous Codeborn walking the Mistway Corridor before disappearing into the fog. Their final words are distorted but mention “the cycle breaking.”

## **Rewards**
- Resonance Level 2
- New emotional synergy (Calm Pulse or Courage Spark)
- Mistway Travel Node unlocked
- Increased bond strength

## **Quest Completion State**
The Mistway Corridor stabilizes.
Somnia acknowledges that the corruption is reacting faster than expected.
Your Cyberkin becomes more attuned to your emotions.
The Dream Sector opens a path toward the next major region.
