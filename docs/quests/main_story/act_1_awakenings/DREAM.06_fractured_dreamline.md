DREAM.06

## **Sector**
Dream Sector — Dreamline Rift

## **Quest Type**
- Main Story

## **Narrative Purpose**
This quest reveals that the Dream Sector’s foundational structure—the Dreamline—is fracturing under the corruption’s pressure. The player learns that the Dreamline connects all Dream Nodes and acts as the subconscious backbone of NetGrid. Its collapse would sever the connection between Codeborn and their Cyberkin. The player must stabilize the Dreamline and confront an Echo that has learned to manipulate memories.

## **Quest Summary**
After defeating the Name‑Echo, Somnia sends the player to investigate a rupture in the Dreamline. The Dreamline Rift is a chaotic space where memories, emotions, and corrupted resonance collide. The player must navigate shifting dream geometry, protect their Cyberkin from memory distortion, and confront the Memory‑Thief Echo—an entity that steals and rewrites memories. Defeating it stabilizes the Dreamline temporarily and reveals a memory fragment showing the player’s past self interacting with Somnia.
