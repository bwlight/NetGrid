Dream Sector — Threshold Gate

## **Quest Type**
- Main Story

## **Narrative Purpose**
This quest reveals the Dream Sector’s true role as a stabilizer and warning system. The player learns that the corruption is beginning to seep into the Dream Layer itself, something that should be impossible. Somnia prepares the player for their first real-world Sector dive and reveals that the Dream Sector cannot hold the corruption back much longer.

## **Quest Summary**
The player and their Cyberkin follow Somnia to the Threshold Gate, a shimmering boundary between the Dream Sector and the physical Sectors of NetGrid. The gate is flickering, destabilized by corruption. The player must help Somnia anchor the gate, confront a stronger Echo that has breached the Dream Layer, and learn how to use resonance to open Sector pathways. Completing the quest unlocks the ability to travel to the first real Sector.
