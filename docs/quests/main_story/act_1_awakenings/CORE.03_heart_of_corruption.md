Sector 1 — Corruption Heart Chamber

## **Quest Type**
- Main Story

## **Narrative Purpose**
This quest reveals the core corruption source within the first Sector and sets up the first major confrontation with a corruption entity that is aware of the player. The player learns that the corruption is not just spreading — it is being directed. The Guardian reveals that the corruption has a “heart” in each Sector, and destroying or purifying it is the only way to stabilize the region.

## **Quest Summary**
Following the Guardian’s purified resonance, the player enters the Corruption Heart Chamber, a pulsating cavern filled with corrupted energy. The corruption reacts violently to the player’s presence. The player must navigate the chamber, avoid corruption pulses, and confront the Heart‑Beast — a massive corruption entity that seems to recognize the player. Defeating it stabilizes the Sector and reveals a memory fragment tied to the player’s past cycle.
