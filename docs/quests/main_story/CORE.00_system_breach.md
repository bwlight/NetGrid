## **Narrative Purpose**
Introduce the player to NetGrid through a false “beta test” tutorial, then violently transition into the real world as the corruption cycle begins. Establish the tone, the stakes, and the mystery.

## **Quest Summary**
The player completes a friendly onboarding simulation with a temporary Cyberkin.
