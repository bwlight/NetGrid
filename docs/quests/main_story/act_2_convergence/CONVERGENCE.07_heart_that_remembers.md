## **Sector**
Prime Heart Domain — Chamber of Cycles

## **Quest Type**
- Main Story
- Convergence Arc

## **Narrative Purpose**
This quest is the emotional and narrative climax of Act II. The player finally reaches the Prime Heart — the ancient, sentient source of all cycles and corruption. The Prime Heart recognizes the player, revealing that they have confronted it many times before. This confrontation sets the stage for Act III: the Cyclebreaker arc.

## **Quest Summary**
After stabilizing the Heart’s Threshold and opening the Heartbound Gate, the player enters the Chamber of Cycles — the Prime Heart’s true domain. The Prime Heart awakens fully, calling the player by name and showing visions of every past cycle. The player must survive the Heart’s resonance waves, confront the Echo of Their Past Self, and endure the Heart’s judgment. The Prime Heart reveals the truth: the player once chose to reset the cycle, and the corruption is the echo of that choice.
