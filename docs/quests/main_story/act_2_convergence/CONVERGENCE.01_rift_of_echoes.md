CONVERGENCE.01

## **Sector**
The Convergence Rift — Between Dream and Core

## **Quest Type**
- Main Story
- Major Crossover Event

## **Narrative Purpose**
This quest marks the first true collision between the Dream Sector and the Core Sectors. The player is pulled into a liminal space where memories, emotions, and corrupted reality merge. The Echo‑Harbinger and the Heart‑Beast threads converge into a single entity that recognizes the player from past cycles. This is the turning point that launches Act II.

## **Quest Summary**
After Somnia’s sacrifice and the Guardian’s warning, the player is dragged into the Convergence Rift — a chaotic realm where Dream and Core overlap. The player must navigate shifting terrain, confront hybrid Echo‑Beasts, and face the Rift‑Warden, a corruption entity that spans both layers. The Rift reveals a memory of the player’s past cycle failing at this exact moment. Stabilizing the Rift opens the path deeper into Act II.

- Navigate hybrid Dream/Core terrain  
- Protect your Cyberkin from resonance overload  
- Defeat hybrid Echo‑Beasts

## **Sector State**
The Convergence Rift is unstable and surreal.  
Dream fractals merge with corrupted Core terrain.  
Gravity shifts unpredictably.  
Voices from past cycles echo through the void.  
The Rift‑Warden’s presence distorts everything.

## **Cyberkin Emotional Beat**
Your Cyberkin is overwhelmed by the hybrid resonance.
