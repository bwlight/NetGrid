## **Quest Title**
The Echoing Path

## **Quest Code**
CONVERGENCE.02

## **Sector**
The Convergence Pathway — Between Layers

## **Quest Type**
- Main Story
- Convergence Arc

## **Narrative Purpose**
This quest deepens the player’s journey through the merged Dream/Core reality. The Echoing Path is a corridor of fractured memories and corrupted resonance that reveals how deeply the cycles have repeated. The player learns that the corruption is not only aware of them — it has been *waiting* for them. This quest builds tension toward the Act II midpoint and the first major revelation about the true nature of the cycle.

## **Quest Summary**
After escaping the Rift of Echoes, the player finds themselves on the Echoing Path — a long, shifting corridor where past cycles bleed into the present. Echo‑shades of previous Codeborn appear, some warning the player, others attacking them. The player must navigate the unstable path, confront the Echo‑Shade of their own past self, and stabilize the corridor long enough to reach the next region of Act II.

## **Objectives**
- Enter the Echoing Path  
- Navigate shifting memory corridors  
- Confront Echo‑Shades of past Codeborn  
- Protect your Cyberkin from resonance backlash  
- Face the Echo of Your Past Self  
- Stabilize the Pathway’s exit point  

## **Sector State**
The Echoing Path is unstable and surreal.  
Memories from past cycles flicker in and out.  
Echo‑Shades wander aimlessly or attack on sight.  
The corridor bends, loops, and fractures unpredictably.  
Your own voice echoes from ahead.
